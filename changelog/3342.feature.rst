pytest now includes inline type annotations and exposes them to user programs.
Most of the user-facing API is covered, as well as internal code.

If you are running a type checker such as mypy on your tests, you may start
noticing type errors indicating incorrect usage. If you run into an error that
you believe to be incorrect, please let us know in an issue.

The types were developed against mypy version 0.780. Older versions may work,
but we recommend using at least this version. Other type checkers may work as
well, but they are not officially verified to work by pytest yet.
