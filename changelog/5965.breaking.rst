symlinks are no longer resolved during collection and matching `conftest.py` files with test file paths.

Resolving symlinks for the current directory and during collection was introduced as a bugfix in 3.9.0, but it actually is a new feature which had unfortunate consequences in Windows and surprising results in other platforms.

The team decided to step back on resolving symlinks at all, planning to review this in the future with a more solid solution (see discussion in
`#6523 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/6523>`__ for details).

This might break test suites which made use of this feature; the fix is to create a symlink
for the entire test tree, and not only to partial files/tress as it was possible previously.
